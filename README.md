# Amika AI ***\[a-mee-ka]*** | {she/her}
Amika is a voice AI that assists you with everyday tasks. Auto-updating is a great feature too. It comes with a YML dataset to reference off of and train. Our key tasks is home automation, streaming from the internet and a graphics UI ready to surprise your eyes. Get Amika the voice AI now!

## Training
We train Amika using a dataset you can find in our stable builds. You can contribute to this file using pull requests. Help make Amika an AI we desire and respect.

## Source code
All the source code is listed in our files.

## Tasks we work on
### Our high priority tasks
- Streaming radio stations
- Streaming music from other sources and websites (Spotify, YouTube Music)
- Voice intercommunication between local Amika devices
- A website/app where Amika devices can be configured. (In progress)
### Our low priority tasks
- Play podcasts, ambient sounds
- Set timers and alarms
- Get news reports located in your region
- Controlling smart home devices
- Making voice calls via Bluetooth interfaces

## Our aimed platform
We hope to put our software on a RPi and experiment with what we are given on the RPi (camera, audio output)
- An ultimate challenge is integrating it with audio input.
- The RPi will run Debian Bullseye and higher (if there is a higher version) (64-bit)
- Aimed platform does not currently work as expected. (USB microphone isn't being detected)
- To run Amika on a Raspberry Pi device, your device will need wi-fi, bluetooth, a microphone (audio input), a speaker (audio output) to work correctly.
- Amika uses AI, it is required to have internet on any device while running the voice assistant.

# Install Amika on a general device
